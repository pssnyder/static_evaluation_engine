# Cece v1.3 Evaluation Redesign Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Philosophy
Convert all evaluation scores to **pawn-relative values** where:
- **1.0 pawn = 100 centipawns** (maintains current material scale)
- **Values < 0.5 pawns** = Minor positional factors
- **Values 0.5-1.0 pawns** = Significant positional advantages
- **Values 1.0-2.0 pawns** = Major positional/tactical factors
- **Values > 2.0 pawns** = Game-changing advantages

## ðŸ“Š Current Value Analysis

### Static Values Needing Redesign
- **PST penalties**: Knight h3 (-0.30 pawns), Queen h8 (-0.30 pawns) â†’ **Too weak**
- **King safety**: Attack penalty (0.15 pawns), Exposed king (1.0 pawn)
- **Castling**: Rights bonus (0.15 pawns), Castled bonus (0.50 pawns)
- **Development**: Currently minimal penalties for poor development

### Values That Work Well
- **Material balance**: Already piece-value based âœ“
- **SEE evaluation**: Already piece-exchange based âœ“
- **Threat assessment**: Already piece-value based âœ“

## ðŸ¤” Strategic Questions for You

### 1. **Piece Value Philosophy**
You mentioned **bishop pair vs individual pieces**. Let's clarify:

**Current values**: Knight (3.2), Bishop (3.3) - very close
**Your preference**: 
- Two bishops > Two knights (bishop pair bonus)
- One bishop < One knight (when pair is broken)

**Questions**:
- How much bonus should a bishop pair get? (0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 pawns?)
- How much penalty should a lone bishop get vs lone knight? (0.1, 0.2 pawns?)
- Should this apply in all game phases or just middle/endgame?

### 2. **PST Penalty Severity**
**Current**: Knight rim penalty (-0.30 pawns) - clearly too weak

**Questions**:
- How severely should rim knights be penalized? (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 pawns?)
- Should corner squares be even worse? (1.5, 2.0 pawns?)
- What about early queen development - how bad is Qh5 on move 2? (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 pawns?)

### 3. **Development Priority**
**Questions**:
- How much bonus for proper piece development? (0.2, 0.3, 0.5 pawns per piece?)
- Should there be penalties for moving the same piece twice in opening? (0.3, 0.5 pawns?)
- Castling urgency - how important is early castling to your style? (0.5, 1.0 pawns?)

### 4. **Tactical vs Positional Balance**
**Current imbalance**: Positional factors too weak vs tactical

**Questions**:
- In your style, what's more important: avoiding bad positions or finding tactical shots?
- Should a 0.5 pawn positional advantage outweigh a 0.3 pawn tactical opportunity?
- How much should the engine prioritize long-term position vs immediate tactics?

### 5. **King Safety Philosophy**
**Questions**:
- How paranoid should the engine be about king safety? 
- Is a safe king worth sacrificing 0.5 pawns of material?
- Should exposed king penalties be severe (1.5+ pawns) or moderate (0.5-1.0 pawns)?

## ðŸ’¡ Proposed Evaluation Flow

### Phase 1: Dynamic Piece Values
1. **Base piece values** (Pawn=100, Knight=320, etc.)
2. **Apply position-based modifiers**:
   - Bishop pair bonus/penalty
   - Piece activity multipliers  
   - Game phase adjustments
3. **Calculate adjusted piece values** for this position

### Phase 2: Positional Evaluation
1. Use **adjusted piece values** for all calculations
2. **PST bonuses/penalties** in pawn-relative terms
3. **Development tracking** with proper scaling
4. **King safety** with meaningful penalties

### Phase 3: Integration
1. All scores in **pawn-equivalent centipawns**
2. **Clear priority ordering** based on your strategy
3. **GUI-friendly scaling** (Â±300 = Â±3 pawns advantage)

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. **Get your input** on the strategic questions above
2. **Design the new piece value system** with dynamic adjustments
3. **Rebalance all static values** to proper pawn equivalents
4. **Test and tune** the new evaluation balance
