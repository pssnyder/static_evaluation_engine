# Static Evaluation Chess Engine
## A fresh start, build from the collective knowledge of past static, neural, and hybrid evaluation engines.

### Overview
This project aims to create a chess engine that utilizes static evaluation techniques, drawing from the successes and failures of previous engines. The goal is to get back to basics and build from the ground up, keeping to simple implementations, but using the best practices learned from past experiences.

### Features
- **Static Evaluation**: Focus on static evaluation methods to assess board positions.
- **GUI Compatibility**: Designed to work with various chess GUIs.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and modify for future enhancements.
