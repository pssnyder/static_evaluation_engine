# Hybrid Chess Engine
## A modern chess engine combining python-chess infrastructure with custom evaluation

### Overview
This project is a hybrid chess engine that leverages the proven python-chess library for core infrastructure while maintaining full control over evaluation logic and data collection. This approach enables rapid development, reliable operation, and focused research on chess evaluation and analysis.

### Key Benefits
- **Proven Infrastructure**: Uses python-chess for move generation, board representation, and search algorithms
- **Custom Evaluation**: Full control over position assessment, pattern recognition, and scoring
- **Research Focus**: Comprehensive data collection for analysis, tuning, and machine learning
- **Professional Quality**: UCI-compliant with robust time management and tournament features
- **Ethical Development**: Proper attribution and GPL-3.0 compliance

### Architecture
The engine combines the best of both worlds:

**Infrastructure (python-chess)**:
- Move generation and validation
- Board representation and game state
- Search algorithms and time management
- UCI protocol implementation

**Custom Components**:
- `evaluation.py` - Your chess evaluation with tunable parameters
- `data_collector.py` - Comprehensive thought and idea logging
- `hybrid_engine.py` - Engine core that injects custom evaluation
- `engine.py` - User-friendly interface with analysis tools
- `uci_interface.py` - UCI protocol handler for GUI compatibility

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install python-chess

# Test the engine
python test_engine.py

# Run with UCI interface (for chess GUIs)
python uci_interface.py

# Interactive analysis
python -c "from engine import ChessEngine; e = ChessEngine(); e.analyze_position()"
```

### Features
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Delegates infrastructure to python-chess, focuses on evaluation
- **Custom Evaluation**: Material, positional, tactical, and pattern-based assessment
- **Data Collection**: Detailed logging of evaluation decisions and search patterns
- **Parameter Tuning**: Real-time adjustment of evaluation weights
- **Research Tools**: Position analysis, benchmarking, and data export
- **UCI Compliance**: Full compatibility with chess GUIs and tournaments

### Performance
- **Search Speed**: ~5,400 nodes per second on test hardware
- **Reliability**: Built on battle-tested python-chess foundation
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized data structures and garbage collection
- **Tournament Ready**: Robust time management and error handling

### Data Collection & Analysis
The engine provides comprehensive data collection for research:
- **Thoughts**: Individual evaluation decisions with full context
- **Ideas**: Principal variations and strategic patterns
- **Export Tools**: JSON data export for analysis and machine learning
- **Tuning Interface**: Real-time parameter adjustment and testing

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Analysis
```python
from engine import ChessEngine

engine = ChessEngine()
engine.set_position("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1")
analysis = engine.analyze_position()
print(f"Evaluation: {analysis['total_score']}")
```

#### Parameter Tuning
```python
engine.tune_evaluation('material', 1.2)  # Increase material weight
engine.tune_evaluation('king_safety', 0.2)  # Adjust king safety weight
```

#### Data Collection
```python
# Play some moves and collect data
engine.play_move_sequence(['e2e4', 'e7e5', 'g1f3', 'b8c6'])
data = engine.export_analysis_data('analysis.json')
```

### Technical Details
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Dependencies**: python-chess (GPL-3.0)
- **Board Representation**: python-chess Board class
- **Search Algorithm**: Alpha-beta with custom evaluation
- **Evaluation**: Custom tunable weights and pattern recognition
- **Protocol**: Universal Chess Interface (UCI)
- **License**: GPL-3.0 (compatible with python-chess)

### Attribution
